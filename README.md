# weather-station
A smart weather monitoring system using multiple communication protocols for real-time data acquisition and transmission.
The BME280 and DS18B20 sensors measure temperature, pressure, and humidity. The readings from these sensors can be read through an LCD via I2C, a webserver, and a bluetooth terminal & LoRa is implemented for long range transmission of the readings.
